    <h1>User Guide</h1>
    <p>Using SumAloud is pretty simple. The Design Team made it so that every functionality can be found in a simple
        user interface, which can be broken down into 3 parts:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Summary Length Selection</li>
        <li>Summary Preview</li>
        <li>Summary Download</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here is the complete User Manual to guide you through the different functionalities.</p>
